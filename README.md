#  Wireframing

Wireframing is a foundational step in the UI/UX design process that involves creating a basic visual guide to suggest the structure and layout of a user interface. These low-fidelity representations help designers, developers, and stakeholders focus on functionality, user flow, and information hierarchy without being distracted by design details such as colors, fonts, or graphics.

## Why Wireframing Matters

Wireframing plays a critical role in the design and development process for several reasons:

- **Clarifies Structure**: It outlines the skeleton of a page or application, helping teams align on layout before development.
- **Improves Usability**: By focusing on user interactions and functionality early, teams can identify and solve usability issues upfront.
- **Enhances Communication**: Wireframes serve as a visual communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- **Saves Time and Resources**: Iterating on wireframes is faster and more cost-effective than making changes after high-fidelity designs or code implementation.
